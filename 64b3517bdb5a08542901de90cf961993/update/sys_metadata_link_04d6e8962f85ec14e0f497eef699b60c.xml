The Emperor&amp;#39;s Deep Core exploration efforts start in this system. It remains one of the more easily and frequently visited systems in the Deep Core.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astronavigation Data:&lt;/strong&gt; Empress Teta system, Koros sector, Deep Core region Orbital Metrics: 359 days per year / 23.5 hours per day&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government:&lt;/strong&gt; monarchy&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population:&lt;/strong&gt; 310 billion (humans 71%, other 29%)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Languages:&lt;/strong&gt; Basic, High Galactic&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terrain:&lt;/strong&gt; urban, plains, forests, mountains&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Cities:&lt;/strong&gt; Cinnagar&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Areas of Interest:&lt;/strong&gt; Core District, Great Library of Cinnagar, Hyperspace Navigator’s Guildhouse, Mining Guild regional headquarters, carbonite mines&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Exports:&lt;/strong&gt; carbonite, andris spice&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Imports:&lt;/strong&gt; raw materials, technology, foodstuffs&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trade Routes:&lt;/strong&gt; Byss Run, Carbonite Run, Koros Trunk Line&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; none&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; Nestled within the Deep Core region, at the end of the Koros Trunk Line hyperspace route opposite Coruscant, Empress Teta is a major supplier of refined carbonite and andris spice. In theory, the ecumenopolis is ruled by a monarchy. However, the true power in the system is the Mining Guild, a powerful body of resource extraction and refining corporations that have banded together to set prices and protect their influence.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Empress Teta’s economy is dependent on the production of carbonite. In addition to the planet’s own ancient mines, six other worlds in the system are rich in carbonite and these are the current focus of extraction efforts. Once used to carbon-freeze colonists on sleeper ships headed on centuries-long journeys, carbonite has been adapted by mining operations and agriworlds to preserve and protect volatile gases and perishable foodstuffs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Empress Teta is also a major authorized supplier of andris spice throughout the galaxy. Originally used as a food additive and preservative, andris also was a remedy for hibernation sickness, a potential side effect of being frozen&amp;#39; in carbonite. Enterprising criminals eventually discovered a way to refine the spice to act as a powerful stimulant and sensory enhancer. Criminal syndicates have schemed to bribe, pirate, and mine Empress Teta to supply the black market with refined andris. However, the Empire has complicated criminal efforts on the world since rising to power.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Empress Teta has become a key Imperial Hyperspace Security Net checkpoint, restricting unauthorized access to the Deep Core Security Zone. Since the establishment of the Empire, locating Empress Teta has become more confusing for newcomers. While most astronavigation charts refer to the world as Empress Teta, older charts refer to it as Koros or Koros Major, in reference to the world’s ancient name, which is still used by the Koros Trunk Line connecting it to Coruscant. Astrocartographers also often mislabel the planet as Cinnagar, the name of the sprawling city that dominates the surface. Most consider the problem to be typical of bureaucratic red tape resulting from a recent regime change. Others believe Imperial Intelligence has redistributed these older names on purpose, as a subtle technique for restricting non-essential traffic.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GATEWAY TO MYSTERY &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Named for an ancient mythical empress who unified the Koros system in a series of quasi-historical epic poems, the world of Empress Teta is as vital to commerce as it is history, supplying much of the galaxy’s carbonite.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EMPRESS TETA&amp;#39;S HISTORY&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Historians believe Empress Teta is home to one of the galaxy’s most ancient human civilizations, with archaeological sites dating back over 27,000 years. Vast carbonite deposits on both Empress Teta proper and six other worlds in the system are thought to have played a crucial role in early galactic colonization, when slow-moving sleeper ships were used to spread humanity throughout the Core Worlds. Ships would take centuries to reach their destinations, with thousands of colonists aboard frozen in blocks of carbonite for the journey.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Empress Teta’s capital city, Cinnagar, spread over much of the planet as bureaucracy and support industries tried to keep up with the burgeoning galactic demand for carbonite. The population boomed, bringing much of the art, fashion, and culture of nearby Coruscant with it. However, with the planet’s entire economy tied up in the export and refining of carbonite and andris spice, the Mining Guild steadily increased its power within the system, eventually marginalizing the royal family.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EMPRESS TETA AND THE QEL-DROMA EPICS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Empress Teta is a major setting in a series of epic poems set thousands of years in the past that detail the mythical journey of Jedi Knight Ulic Qel-Droma. One story is set a thousand years before the time of Ulic, and tells of Empress Teta’s conquest of the Koros system alongside Jedi Master Odan-Urr, a constant figure throughout the stories. The Sith Empire invaded while Empress Teta was still rebuilding from the Unification Wars, kicking off the Great Hyperspace War. The combined might of Empress Teta and the Jedi Order drove back Sith Lord Naga Sadow’s forces and scattered them across the galaxy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A millennium later, corrupt noble descendants of Empress Teta, empowered by Sith artifacts, formed the Krath, a sadistic dark side cult. After taking over the Empress Teta system in a military coup, the Krath launched a bloody crusade against the Jedi Order. The Krath slaughtered thousands of Jedi, including Ulic’s master. Qel-Droma volunteered to infiltrate the Krath and destroy them from within. Unfortunately, the dark side corrupted Ulic, who took over the Krath, alongside the fallen Jedi Exar Kun. Together, they made Empress Teta a stronghold for a new Sith Empire.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Ulic eventually turned away from the darkness and redeemed himself, but only after being cut off from the Force. Historians believe the epic poems taught young Jedi the dangers of the dark side, but some believe the stories originate in historical fact. Archaeological institutes have launched numerous expeditions in vain attempts to verify the legends.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MODERN HISTORY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;By the start of the Clone Wars, the noble houses of Empress Teta, especially the ruling Keto family, were completely under the control of the Mining Guild, forcing the system to side with the Separatists during the conflict. During this time, most Republic loyalists among the nobility expatriated to Coruscant. Many were rewarded with lofty positions within the Mining Guild or Imperial bureaucracy on Empress Teta after the Clone Wars. Empress Teta became a major supplier of carbonite to worlds providing volatile gases to the Empire to power its military’s energy weapons.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The strategic nature of both Empress Teta’s resources and its position as a gateway to the Deep Core make it an important stronghold for the Empire. Official documents report that the numerous Star Destroyers and support ships of Admiral Yzu’s 15th Deep Core Reserve Fleet are conducting customs patrols to combat smugglers and pirates. However, their duties extend to operating a hyperspace interdiction checkpoint along the only known route beyond the Empress Teta system into the Deep Core.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PEOPLE AND CULTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Empress Teta is typical of other affluent Core Worlds in that much of the planet’s citizenry consists of wealthy aristocrats and social-climbing bureaucrats. Throughout the planetwide city of Cinnagar, denizens and tourists alike can shop at high-end boutiques, tour galactic-class museums, and dine in the region’s finest restaurants. Most Tetans are accustomed to the finer luxuries life has to offer, and strive to better their station in life through promotion or marriage.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;However, many citizens outside Cinnagar’s Core District live a more working-class existence, running struggling small businesses or working in retail. Out of desperation, less fortunate Tetans sometimes turn to blackmail, or make deals with one of the many criminal organizations in an effort to get ahead.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE NOBILITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;While absolute confirmation that Empress Teta is actually the Koros Major of legend remains elusive, the noble lineage that rules the system claims ancestry to the warrior empress of old. The current ruler is Emperor Alor Keto, a weak, ineffectual puppet of the Mining Guild. His rule has lasted several decades, but his health has recently begun to decline. The rightful heir is his niece, Eara Lota, a strong-willed young girl who frequently makes the local holovids for protesting the living conditions on the prison planet of Ronika or the working conditions for miners elsewhere in the system.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The rest of the nobility has a minority share of all Mining Guild operations in the system, granting them immense wealth. Most nobles focus on keeping up appearances among various social circles (some going deep into debt to do so), or on furthering pet causes. Others, however, are ambitious for power beyond what wealth can claim, and climb the corporate ladder of the Mining Guild.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE MINING GUILD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The leading power in the Empress Teta system is the Mining Guild, which ultimately controls the production of all carbonite and andris spice in the system. While hundreds of corporations mine, refine, and package both products in the system, each pays a tithe to the guild and relies on it to resolve disputes with other corporations. The guild maintains a regional headquarters in Cinnagar, where the board of directors can hear from guild masters and supervisors, and direct overall operations. Members on Empress Teta are often mid to high-level bureaucrats, too consumed by internal politics to care much about broader issues.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14pt;"&gt;POINTS OF INTEREST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The planetwide cityscape of Cinnagar dominates Empress Teta, but urban development halted before every bit of nature was covered. Ancient sites hide within and beneath its foundations, awaiting rediscovery.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CINNAGAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The bustling, planetwide bronze and glass urban sprawl that is Cinnagar dominates the planet with all the grace of Coruscant, absent its blatant excesses. The architecture is relatively new, with most foundations dating back only a few thousand years. While the Core District rivals the majesty of any wealthy Core World, most of the surrounding districts center on a single dominant spire, typically an anonymous Mining Guild tower built atop an old mine. Warrens of quaint residential flats and commercial towers surround the central spires to provide quick access to their workforces.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORE DISTRICT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;By far the most upscale part of Cinnagar is the Core District, the Deep Core’s pinnacle experience for fine dining, shopping, and the arts. Bordering the Royal District, the Core District caters to tourists and wealthy nobles who desire a high-end luxury experience, where their every whim is sated. Each building is a work of art all its own, combining architectural styles from across the galaxy. An angular Coruscant glass spire might neighbor the organic curves mimicking Alderaan’s white city of Aldera. Most restaurants and boutiques are themed on specific Core Worlds renowned for that particular cuisine or fashion. The Coronet Nova Steakhouse, Alderaan Museum of Fine Arts, Coruscant Fashions, and Kuat Citywear all bring the culture of the Core Worlds to Empress Teta’s doorstep.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROYAL DISTRICT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Home to the royal family, the Royal District consists of nine golden spires, each representing a different world in the system. They sit along the equatorial axis, aligned in such a way that the morning sun hits them in the same order in which they orbit their star. Low walls connect the towers, protecting a vast, open-air garden dotted with the lavish cottages of favored nobles within. At the center of the gardens is an ebon block of iron believed to have come from the ruins of the mythical Iron Citadel, standing as a monument to the ancient legends attributed to the system.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GREAT LIBRARY OF CINNAGAR &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;This enormous, mushroom-shaped building on the border between the Core District and Royal District recalls the Senate Building on Coruscant. Beneath its dull bronze dome is the largest storehouse of public information on Empress Teta, featuring billions of collected writings, stories, holovids, and transcripts. It also houses a museum dedicated to the mythical battles of the Qel-Droma Epics. Real artifacts from the era accompany artistic recreations of many of the characters and machines of war used by both sides. The role of Empress Teta and her victory in the Unification Wars and the subsequent Great Hyperspace War are the focus of the exhibits. Like most denizens of Empress Teta, the museum presents the epics as factual history, without a hint of skepticism, making the library a frequent target of academics outside the system.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HYPERSPACE NAVIGATOR&amp;#39;S GUILDHOUSE &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Formerly the headquarters for the entire Navigator’s Guild, the guildhouse on Empress Teta has seen better days since the rise of the Empire. Imperials have copied its databases, classified several routes for military use, and banned entire vectors of exploration. Once a bustling hub for daring pilots exploring the Deep Core and Wild Space, the guildhouse has recently begun selling routes and database access to those with questionable motives, simply to keep its operation afloat.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The guildhouse is an ancient Tetan mansion made from local, now-extinct woods. The mansion has been moved several times and currently sits upon a tower shaped like an eight-pointed navigator’s compass. The tower contains docking bays, powerful comms equipment capable of punching through the radiation of the Deep Core, and endless stacks of computers containing hyperspace data. In front of the tower is a monument to lost navigators, a massive carbonite statue of the ancient, unnamed patriarch of the Coruscanti family that allegedly blazed the Koros Trunk Line on a generation ship.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEGENDARY SITES &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Many Tetans take the Qel-Droma Epics as their system’s literal history, spurring fruitless expeditions for ancient battlegrounds and relics from a lost age of heroes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRON CITADEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;A massive stone palace named for its iron battlements, the Iron Citadel was once home to the crown of Koros Major. It was thought impenetrable, having repelled invasions and infiltrations by the Republic, the Jedi Order; the Mandalorians, and the Sith. Only the Krath were able to take the citadel, and only thanks to betrayal from within. The Krath used it as a command center from which they directed their crusade to wipe out the Jedi.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The locals believe the Iron Citadel once stood in the center of the modern Royal Palace, where a large block of twisted iron rests as a monument to legendary days. A small minority claim the citadel is beneath the spires of the Royal District, still visited by remnants of the Krath within the royal bloodline. Others believe the Republic destroyed the citadel while retaking the system from the Krath. Most outside Empress Teta doubt it ever existed at all.&lt;/div&gt;]]&gt;&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Empress Teta System (Koros Major)&lt;/name&gt;
