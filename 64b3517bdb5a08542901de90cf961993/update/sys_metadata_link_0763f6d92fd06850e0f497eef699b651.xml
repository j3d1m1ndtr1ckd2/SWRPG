        <description>For untold ages, the spice called yarrock has been produced on Iridonia, created by their shamans to grant their warriors a greater clarity of mind and violent purpose. Though there are other drugs that fit this description scattered across the galaxy, many seasoned warriors respond with respect, adulation, or even fear to the mere sight of the signature black pellets that contain yarrock. A soldier under the effects of yarrock is ruthless, and able to shrug off tremendous physical hardship. Unfortunately, for every high there is a crash, and this drug is no exceptionâ€”as a dose runs its course, its effect seems to reverse, and every step becomes an endless journey until the warrior can metabolize the chemicals or simply collapses from exhaustion. Some also say that the drug has a further effect on the user's very soul, drawing it deeper and deeper into the shadows as time goes on, but validated scientific data on this particular concern is understandably scarce. Yarrock lasts for one scene. A character under the&#13;
effects of yarrock is not required to make any Fear checks; he counts as succeeding automatically. However, once he has used yarrock, he must also add 1 setback die to any Willpower or Presence-related checks for the remainder of the session. &#13;
&#13;
Restrictions: Yarrock is quite rare, and thus few planets explicitly regulate its use, as the only shipments go through black market traders.</description>
