        &lt;description&gt;Illegal throughout most of the civilized worlds, disruptors focus such a highly energized beam of particles that they can disintegrate limbs or other large parts of their victim's bodies. The technology is essentially that of a blaster rifle, but with an oversized XCiter and a specialized actuating module that processes a much higher volume of blaster gas than usual. This combines with a galven cylinder that super-focuses the resultant beam. Most disruptor weapons have a very poor range, although some rifle variants have a boosted range through expensive reinforced galven cylinders and are designed specifically for snipers and sharpshooters.&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
The Tenloss Syndicate manufactures one of the few mass-produced disruptors, the DXR-6 rifle and the DX-2 pistol. Their main client is the notorious Black Sun criminal organization, but they also service a smattering of ruthless rogues and other scoundrels. A few Imperial inquisitors and interrogators have been known to brandish these weapons as well, but perhaps more for the intimidation and terror factor than their practicality.&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
Whenever a victim is hit by a disruptor, any Critical Hit results in a "Crippled" effect unless the roll on Table 6-10 would result in an even more grievous injury. Disruptors may never benefit from upgrades or attachments that improve their range or grant multiple shots. &amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
Models Include: Tenloss DXR-6 Disruptor Rifle, Tenloss DX-2 Disruptor Pistol.&lt;/description&gt;
