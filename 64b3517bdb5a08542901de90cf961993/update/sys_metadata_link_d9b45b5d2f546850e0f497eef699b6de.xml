        <description>A weapon with Auto-fire can be set to shoot in rapid succession and potentially spray an area with bolts, flechettes, slugs, or other types of projectiles. The advantage in using Auto-fire is that it has the chance to hit multiple targets or hit a single target multiple times.&#13;
&#13;
Attacking with a weapon on Auto-fire is generally less accurate and the attacker must increase the difficulty of the attack check by 1 difficulty die . The user may choose to not use the Auto-fire quality on a weapon; in this case, he cannot trigger the quality but also does not suffer the aforementioned penalty.&#13;
&#13;
If the attack hits, the attacker can trigger Auto-fire by spending 2 advantage.  Auto-fire can be triggered multiple times. Each time the attacker triggers auto-fire, it deals an additional hit to the target. Each of these counts as an additional hit from that weapon, and each hit deals base damage plus the number of uncanceled successes on the check.&#13;
&#13;
These additional hits can be allocated to the target, or to other targets within range of the weapon. If the attacker wishes to hit multiple targets, he must decide to do so before making the check. Furthermore, if he wishes to hit multiple targets, his initial target must always be the target with the highest difficulty and highest defense (if this is two separate targets, the GM chooses which target is his initial target). The initial hit must always be against the initial target, subsequent hits generated can&#13;
be allocated to any of the other designated targets.&#13;
&#13;
Auto-fire weapons can also activate one Critical Injury for each hit generated on the attack per the normal cost; the Critical must target the target of the specific hit.</description>
