        <description>From the basic, utilitarian staff of a nerf herder to high-tech weapons used to subdue unruly mobs, staffs are ubiquitous throughout the galaxy. However, what would normally be a simple and common tool can be modified into a uniquely effective weapon against Force users through the use of refined corto- sis. In most forms, cortosis ore resists and absorbs energy, allowing items to withstand blows from weapons that would normally shatter them. However, specifically refined cortosis has a unique secondary effect: it can short out lightsaber blades on contact. Working with this refined cortosis is extremely difficult due to the properties of the ore, and even making a simple weapon like a staff is inordinately expensive. However, such weapons can prove a deadly advantage if someone has to face down a lightsaber-wielding enemy.&#13;
&#13;
When a character armed with a lightsaber makes a combat check targeting an opponent armed with a refined cortosis staff, 3 threat or 1 despair can be spent to cause the lightsaber to short out and deactivate after the combat check has been resolved. When a character armed with a refined cortosis staff makes a combat check targeting a character armed with a lightsaber, the attacking character may spend 3 advantage or 1 triumph to cause the lightsaber to short out and deactivate after the combat check has been resolved.&#13;
&#13;
The lightsaber may be reactivated as an incidental, but it may not be reactivated until after the last Initiative slot during the next round. Cortosis staffs require two hands to use.&#13;
